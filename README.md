## 概要

本篇只是提供启动和运行 npm 的基本信息。

一旦完成安装，你可以通过 `npm help` 来获取更多的信息。

## IMPORTANT 重要

**你需要 v4 或者更高版本的 node 来运行 npm**

To install an old **and unsupported** version of npm that works on node v0.12 and prior, clone the git repo and dig through the old tags and branches.

**npm is configured to use npm, Inc.'s public package registry at <https://registry.npmjs.org> by default.**

You can configure npm to use any compatible registry you like, and even run your own registry. Check out the [doc on registries](https://docs.npmjs.com/misc/registry).

Use of someone else's registry may be governed by terms of use. The terms of use for the default public registry are available at <https://www.npmjs.com>.

## Super Easy Install

npm is bundled with [node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).

### Windows 系统电脑

[Get the MSI](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).  npm is in it.

### 苹果系统电脑

[Get the pkg](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).  npm is in it.

### 其他类型

Run `make install`.  npm will be installed with node.

If you want a more fancy pants install (a different version, customized paths, etc.) then read on.

## Fancy Install (Unix)

There's a pretty robust install script at <https://www.npmjs.com/install.sh>.  You can download that and run it.

Here's an example using curl:

```sh
curl -L https://www.npmjs.com/install.sh | sh
```

### Slightly Fancier

You can set any npm configuration params with that script:

```sh
npm_config_prefix=/some/path sh install.sh
```

Or, you can run it in uber-debuggery mode:

```sh
npm_debug=1 sh install.sh
```

### Even Fancier

Get the code with git.  Use `make` to build the docs and do other stuff. If you plan on hacking on npm, `make link` is your friend.

If you've got the npm source code, you can also semi-permanently set arbitrary config keys using the `./configure --key=val ...`, and then run npm commands by doing `node bin/npm-cli.js <command> <args>`.  (This is helpful for testing, or running stuff without actually installing npm itself.)

## Windows Install or Upgrade

Many improvements for Windows users have been made in npm 3 - you will have a better experience if you run a recent version of npm. To upgrade, either use [Microsoft's upgrade tool](https://github.com/felixrieseberg/npm-windows-upgrade), [download a new version of Node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/), or follow the Windows upgrade instructions in the [npm Troubleshooting Guide](./TROUBLESHOOTING.md).

If that's not fancy enough for you, then you can fetch the code with git, and mess with it directly.

## Installing on Cygwin

No.

## Uninstalling

So sad to see you go.

```sh
sudo npm uninstall npm -g
```
Or, if that fails,

```sh
sudo make uninstall
```

## More Severe Uninstalling

Usually, the above instructions are sufficient.  That will remove npm, but leave behind anything you've installed.

If you would like to remove all the packages that you have installed, then you can use the `npm ls` command to find them, and then `npm rm` to remove them.

To remove cruft left behind by npm 0.x, you can use the included `clean-old.sh` script file.  You can run it conveniently like this:

```sh
npm explore npm -g -- sh scripts/clean-old.sh
```

npm uses two configuration files, one for per-user configs, and another
for global (every-user) configs.  You can view them by doing:

```sh
npm config get userconfig   # defaults to ~/.npmrc
npm config get globalconfig # defaults to /usr/local/etc/npmrc
```

Uninstalling npm does not remove configuration files by default.  You must remove them yourself manually if you want them gone.  Note that this means that future npm installs will not remember the settings that you have chosen.

## More Docs 更多文档

查看 [文档](https://docs.npmjs.com/).

你可以使用 `npm help` 命令来了解它们中的任何一个。

如果你是一个开发者，并且想用 npm 来发布程序，那你应该[阅读这个](https://docs.npmjs.com/misc/developers)。

## BUGS

当你发现问题时，请上报给我们：

* 网站：<https://github.com/npm/npm/issues>

确保包含 npm 命令不能按预期工作所输出的**所有**内容。提供 `npm-debug.log` 文件也是有帮助的。

You can also find npm people in `#npm` on https://package.community/ or [on Twitter](https://twitter.com/npm_support).  Whoever responds will no doubt tell you to put the output in a gist or email.
